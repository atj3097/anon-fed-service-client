## Client Module Service

The Client Module Service is a microservice that provides APIs for data encryption, local model training, and zk-SNARK proof generation. It interacts with the Smart Contract Service to submit encrypted model updates and zk-SNARK proofs, and retrieves the global model from IPFS after obtaining the IPFS hash from the smart contract. The service is responsible for handling the encryption of data before it is sent to the Smart Contract Service for aggregation, and for generating zk-SNARK proofs to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data. Overall, the Client Module Service plays a critical role in ensuring the secure and private training of our global machine learning model.


Here's a high-level overview of the architecture of the client module service:

- The client module service is one of the microservices that make up the overall federated learning system. It is responsible for handling incoming requests from users to upload their preprocessed data to the system.

- The client module service is implemented as a Python module that runs within a virtual environment. It uses the PySyft library to perform secure multi-party computation (SMPC) operations on the encrypted data.

- The client module service includes a VirtualWorker object that represents the client and is used to perform SMPC operations on the encrypted data. The VirtualWorker object is created using the PySyft library.

- When a user uploads their preprocessed data to the system, the client module service receives the data as a POST request to a Flask route. The data is typically in the form of a CSV or JSON file, but the exact format may vary depending on the specific application.

- The client module service loads the preprocessed data into a PyTorch tensor and encrypts it using SMPC. This involves dividing the data into shares and distributing the shares among the different parties involved in the federated learning system.

- The encrypted data is then sent to the server component for further processing. The exact implementation of this step will depend on your choice of communication protocol and whether you're using any existing libraries or frameworks to build your federated learning system.

- The client module service is designed to be modular and loosely coupled from the other microservices in the federated learning system. This allows it to evolve independently and be deployed, scaled, or updated without affecting other services.


The flow of data and control in the Client Module Service is as follows:

The Flask application receives preprocessed data from the Frontend UI.
The Encryption module encrypts the data using PySyft.
The Local Training module trains a local model on the encrypted data using PyTorch and torchvision.
The Proof module generates a zk-SNARK proof for the updated model parameters using a library such as libsnark or zokrates.
The Flask application submits the proof to the Smart Contract running on a blockchain platform such as Ethereum.
The Smart Contract verifies the proof and updates the global model.
The encrypted global model is stored on a decentralized storage system such as IPFS.
